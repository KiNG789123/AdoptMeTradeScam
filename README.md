Lets you take pets out of the confirm screen on adopt me! (Might get patched soon!)
Tutorial:
1) run the script
2) wait 30 seconds for it to load
3) trade someone
4) put in your good pets
5) wait for them to accept first
6) the script will accept the trade for you
7) make them confirm first
8) the script will take out the pets you put in and make you confirm!
9) enjoy your pets!

if it doesn't work, try get someone to trade you instead. if it still doesnt work it may be patched or the script isnt supported on your executor
